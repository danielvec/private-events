# Private Events

This is my implementation of the Private Events project from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events).

## Project Requirements

The goal of this project is to build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

**Features**

- Uses devise to restrict site access to members

- Allows users to create, edit, and delete events

- Allows users to sign up for events

- Displays all events on homepage categorized by upcoming and past events

- Displays a list of events attending and events attended on user pages

## Rspec Tests

To run the tests, enter the following from the command line:  
`rspec`
